          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            I am currently in my final year of university. I study at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). I am studying a Bachelor of Infomration Technology majoring in Computer Science. I am also 
            completing two minors. These are: Mobile Application Development and Networks and Security. Most of my study has been programming orientated but I have completed a number of units on design. I have 
            also completed units in the area of data security. Most of my networking minor has been based around setting up functional networks with proper security in a lab environment however, I have had 
            experience in configuring actual routers and creating functioning networks on campus. I have basic network and web penetration experience.
