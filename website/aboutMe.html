        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          I am currently in my final year of university. I study at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology majoring in Computer Science. I am also 
          completing two minors. These are: Mobile Application Development and Networks and Security. Most of my study has been programming orientated but I have completed a number of units on design. I have 
          also completed units in the area of data security. Most of my networking minor has been based around setting up functional networks with proper security in a lab environment however, I have had 
          experience in configuring actual routers and creating functioning networks on campus. I have basic network penetration and web penetration experience.
        </p>

          <div class="infoTable-cell"><h3>JavaScript: </h3></div>
          <div class="infoTable-cell">
              I learnt JS throughout high school and I completed a Head Start course at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) furthering my understanding of JS. I have completed a unit in Web Computing involving the use of JS among 
              other languages. This unit also focused on databse security and server security. A requirement for passing was being able to gaurd against SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting. PDO technoglogies in PHP were used to gaurd 
              against sql injection and client/server side validation was used to gaurd against illegal inputs. Regular Expressions were used for this.

            I have taught myself how to use React Native throughout the course of 2018, it is being used to develop the mobile application for my Capstone project. Our Capstone group currently has a fully
            functioning Android application and a fully functioning IOS app. The android applicaiton is currently in a closed beta test on Google Play and the iPhone app is in its final stage of pre alpha 
            testing.

            React to develop a Web First Photogrammetry application called Lazy3D (Repository on Github). There is still a lot of work to do as we have only covered the first 2 steps. These involve the frame extraction from the video and then the cropping of the images.
            At this stage the user can download the cropped images to use in a 3D renderer.
