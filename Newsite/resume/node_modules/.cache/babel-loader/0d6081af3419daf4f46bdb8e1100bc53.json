I have \r\n              also completed courses in the area of data security. Most of my networking minor has been based around setting up functional networks with proper security in a lab environment however, I have had \r\n              experience in configuring actual CISCO routers and switches along with creating functioning networks on campus. I have basic network penetration and web penetration experience along with SQL Injection experience.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"ContactDetails\">\r\n            <h1>Contact Details</h1>\r\n            <Table>\r\n              <tbody>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Full Name</th>\r\n                  <td>Christopher Littlewood</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Email Address</th>\r\n                  <td>clittlewood50@gmail.com</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Date of Birth</th>\r\n                  <td>12 June 1996</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </tbody>\r\n            </Table>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"EducationDetails\">\r\n            <h1>Education Details</h1>\r\n            <Table>\r\n              <tbody>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>High School</th>\r\n                  <td>Urangan State High School</td>\r\n                  <td>ATAR of 96</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Head Start Program</th>\r\n                  <td>University of Southern Queensland</td>\r\n                  <td>GPA of 6</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>University</th>\r\n                  <td>Queensland University of Technology</td>\r\n                  <td>GPA of 5.76</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </tbody>\r\n            </Table>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"rightContentAboutMe\">\r\n          <div className=\"bestSkills\">\r\n            <h1>My Top Skills</h1>\r\n            <Table>\r\n              <tbody>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>HTML</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2011</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>CSS</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2011</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>JavaScript</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2012</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>PHP</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2012</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>MySQL</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2012</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>React</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2018</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>React Native</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2018</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>PL/SQL</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2019</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Bash</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2019</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Microsoft Office Suite</th>\r\n                  <td>Used since I was young, age 10</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Microsoft Visual Studio/Code</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2016</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Atlassian Jira (Dev/Admin/Host)</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2018</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <th>Github</th>\r\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2017</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </tbody>\r\n            </Table>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
