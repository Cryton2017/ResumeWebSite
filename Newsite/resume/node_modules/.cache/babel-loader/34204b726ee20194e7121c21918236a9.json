I have \n              also completed units in the area of data security. Most of my networking minor has been based around setting up functional networks with proper security in a lab environment however, I have had \n              experience in configuring actual routers and creating functioning networks on campus. I have basic network penetration and web penetration experience.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"ContactDetails\">\n            <h1>Contact Details</h1>\n            <Table>\n              <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Full Name</th>\n                  <td>Christopher Littlewood</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Email Address</th>\n                  <td>clittlewood50@gmail.com</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Date of Birth</th>\n                  <td>12 June 1996</td>\n                </tr>\n              </tbody>\n            </Table>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"EducationDetails\">\n            <h1>Education Details</h1>\n            <Table>\n              <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>High School</th>\n                  <td>Urangan State High School</td>\n                  <td>ATAR of 96</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Head Start Program</th>\n                  <td>University of Southern Queensland</td>\n                  <td>GPA of 6</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>University</th>\n                  <td>Queensland University of Technology</td>\n                  <td>GPA of 5.76</td>\n                </tr>\n              </tbody>\n            </Table>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"rightContentAboutMe\">\n          <div className=\"bestSkills\">\n            <h1>My Skills</h1>\n            <Table>\n              <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>HTML</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2011</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>CSS</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2011</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>JavaScript</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2012</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>PHP</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2012</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>MySQL</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2012</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>React</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2018</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>React Native</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2018</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>PL/SQL</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2019</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Bash</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2019</td>\n                </tr>\n              </tbody>\n            </Table>\n            <p>I also have a wide range of experience in languages such as C, C# and Python.</p>\n            <h1>Software Skills</h1>\n            <Table>\n              <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Microsoft Office Suite</th>\n                  <td>Used since I was young, age 10</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Microsoft Visual Studio/Code</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2016</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Atlassian Jira (Dev/Admin/Host)</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2018</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Github</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2017</td>\n                </tr>\n              </tbody>\n            </Table>\n            <p>I also have a wide range of experience in software such as Jetbrains RubyMine and Eclipse.</p>\n          </div>\n          {/* <div className=\"softwareSkills\">\n            <h1>Software Skills</h1>\n            <Table>\n              <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Microsoft Office Suite</th>\n                  <td>Used since I was young, age 10</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Microsoft Visual Studio/Code</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2016</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Atlassian Jira (Dev/Admin/Host)</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2018</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Github</th>\n                  <td>Studied and practiced since 2017</td>\n                </tr>\n              </tbody>\n            </Table>\n            <p>I also have a wide range of experience in software such as Jetbrains RubyMine and Eclipse.</p>\n          </div> */}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
