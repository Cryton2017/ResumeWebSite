              I completed my degree in December 2018. I studied at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). I studied a Bachelor of Information Technology majoring in Computer Science. I also 
              completed two minors. These were: Mobile Application Development and Networks and Security. Most of my experience has focused on software development but I have completed a number of courses on design. I have 
              also completed courses in the area of data security. Most of my networking minor has been based around setting up functional networks with proper security in a lab environment however, I have had 
              experience in configuring actual CISCO routers and switches along with creating functioning networks on campus. I have basic network penetration and web penetration experience along with SQL Injection experience.
