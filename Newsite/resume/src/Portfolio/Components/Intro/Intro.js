          This website was created to show my skills, both as a programmer and a web designer. All features on this website were implemented by me. The exception to this is the use of Bootstrap for the look
          and feel of the website. The reason Bootstrap was used for the theme is that my styling choices are not always the best. I am a programmer not a designer. I feel that using Bootstrap can show a 
          potential employer that I can use different frameworks to build responsive websites.
